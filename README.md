# Discord-CustomCSS
This is the custom style sheet that I use on discord.

I use this via a custom theme with [OpenASAR](https://openasar.dev/), however you can use this with any mod/client that lets
you use custom CSS.

## Using
You can either copy & paste [openasar-config.css](./openasar-config.css), or add the following snippet to your existing CSS:

```css
@import url("https://git.nexy7574.co.uk/nex/discord-customcss/raw/branch/main/openasar-config.css")
```

# Disclaimer
Modifying the discord client is against their terms of service. You use this custom style sheet at your own risk, and I am
not responsible for any issues that may arise.
