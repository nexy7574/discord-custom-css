# Discord-CustomCSS

This is the custom style sheet that I use on discord. It contains many tweaks, such as de-cluttering the message bar, and making NSFW channels more obvious when hovered over.

## Using

You can either copy & paste [openasar-config.css](./openasar-config.css), or add the following snippet to your existing CSS:

```css
@import url("https://nexy7574.co.uk/discord-css/openasar-config.css")
```

or in Vesktop/Vencord, just add the url `https://nexy7574.co.uk/discord-css/openasar-config.css` to the "online themes" section of the Themes setting.
